# TherOS
Lightweight window manager for OpenOS


NOTICE: you will need to manually copy all files in this repo. This was made to be installed via a floppy disk, on a server that no longer exists.

This is also the oldest available release of TherOS, and does not have a lot of the functionality of the modern version.
